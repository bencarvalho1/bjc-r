            Make a sprite keep moving around the screen randomly, using
            <img src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random" />
            blocks (with the correct inputs) inside
            <img src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/blocks/turn-right.png" alt="turn right block" />
            and <img src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/blocks/move.png" alt="move to" />
            blocks.  Some things to keep track of:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                You'll want to use a <img src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block" />
                or <img src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="forever block" /> to keep 
                your sprite moving continuously.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the sprite can travel in any direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                How does your sprite's actions change if you have it move a fixed, rather than random, amount each
                time?  
            </li>
            <li>Keep the pen for your sprite down, and you'll see a two-dimensional 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>.
                </li>

        </ul>
